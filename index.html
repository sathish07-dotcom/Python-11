Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or function in different ways. It is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and literally means "many forms."

üî∏ Types of Polymorphism in Python:
Duck Typing

Operator Overloading

Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)

Method Overloading (Simulated, as Python doesn't support it directly)

1. Duck Typing (Dynamic Typing)
‚ÄúIf it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.‚Äù

python
Copy
Edit
class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow")

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof")

def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.speak()

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

animal_sound(dog)  # Woof
animal_sound(cat)  # Meow
2. Operator Overloading
Python allows us to redefine the behavior of operators for user-defined classes.

python
Copy
Edit
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"

p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(3, 4)
print(p1 + p2)  # (4, 6)
3. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

python
Copy
Edit
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

a = Animal()
d = Dog()

a.speak()  # Animal speaks
d.speak()  # Dog barks
4. Method Overloading (Not directly supported)
Python doesn‚Äôt support method overloading like Java/C++, but we can simulate it:

python
Copy
Edit
class Demo:
    def greet(self, name=None):
        if name:
            print(f"Hello {name}")
        else:
            print("Hello")

obj = Demo()
obj.greet()         # Hello
obj.greet("Sathish")  # Hello Sathish
‚úÖ Summary

Type	Description
Duck Typing	Behavior checked at runtime, not strict types
Operator Overloading	Same operator behaves differently for objects
Method Overriding	Subclass overrides a method in parent class
Method Overloading	Simulated via default/optional arguments
If you want examples related to your own project (e.g., fitness tracker or resume screener), I can show how polymorphism can be used there too. Just say the word!
